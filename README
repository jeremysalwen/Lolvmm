Lolvmm is a C++ library which wraps the C library Lilv 
(http://drobilla.net/software/lilv/), a library for hosting LV2 audio 
processing plugins.  It is designed to have zero overhead, and to be 
intuitive to a C++ developer.

Lilv has it's own C++ wrapper, Lilvmm.  Lolvmm is an alternative library 
which eliminates the additional redirection in Lilvmm, and utilizes 
C++11's auto-pointer functionality to provide easier and more intuitive 
memory management.

Lolvmm is designed to be machine-transparent, i.e. code using Lolvmm 
should compile to exactly the same instructions as if one was to call 
the C functions directly (give or take compiler quirks).  There is a 
single exception to this, when dealing with Plugin Ports.  When calling 
functions on an LilvPort, Lilv requires the LilvPlugin it originates 
from to be passed as an additional argument. Lolvmm wraps a reference to 
both the LilvPort and the LilvPlugin as a Lolv::PortRef.  Lolvmm 
operates entirely on PortRefs, and never on Ports Directly.
